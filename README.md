# game_Project #
Year 2 Project

## What's Here ##
This is a game made in Unity using C# for a group project. All code and asset files are included in the repository and Visual Studio 2017 was used to create the program, therefore, we advide to open the project in Visual Studio 2017 as well.

The project was a year-long project and the necessary documentation has been created to include:
- Analysis,
- Design,
- Testing,
- Evaluation.

This documentation will be attached to the project code.
